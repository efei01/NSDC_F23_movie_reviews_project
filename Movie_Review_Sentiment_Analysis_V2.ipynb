       "1235  Im not going to say that this movie is horrible because I have seen worse but its not even halfway decent The plot is very confusing I couldnt really figure out what was happening and where things were going When the movie was over I was left scratching my head I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two Character development is very shallow I couldnt f..."

       "29   War movie is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat Once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen The Civil Warera Cold Mountain starring Jude Law Nicole Kidman and Rene Zellweger is such a filmThen again calling Cold Mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate True enough the film opens with a quite literally quickanddirty battl...\n",

       "130  Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes  Close ups predominated it Close ups of walls humans and of many other things The warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie a warm atmosphere Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie Silen...\n",

    "### The following passage is the *Oppenheimer* review used as review_sample1\n",
    "\n",
    "Oppenheimer is an exceptional film that deserves the highest praise for its thought-provoking narrative, exquisite craftsmanship, and compelling performances. From the very first frame, the movie draws the audience into the fascinating world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose contributions during World War II profoundly altered the course of history. The films director, screenwriters, and production team have demonstrated remarkable talent and dedication in bringing Oppenheimers complex story to the screen. The meticulous attention to historical accuracy and period details adds a layer of authenticity, transporting viewers back in time to witness the scientific breakthroughs and tumultuous events that unfolded during the Manhattan Project. Cillian Murphys portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. His nuanced and captivating performance captures the inner conflicts and moral dilemmas faced by the renowned physicist as he grapples with the implications of his work. The supporting cast, including outstanding performances by the ensemble, further enriches the films narrative and emotional depth. Oppenheimer stands out not only as a biopic but also as a meditation on the complexities of scientific progress and its impact on humanity. The film delves into the ethical dilemmas faced by scientists during wartime, exploring the weight of their choices and the sacrifices they make for the greater good.　Furthermore, the films cinematography and art direction are stunning, creating a visual feast for the eyes. The sweeping landscapes, haunting laboratories, and evocative period settings transport viewers back to the 1940s, immersing them fully in the eras atmosphere. One of the films greatest strengths lies in its ability to strike an emotional chord with the audience. It deftly navigates the intricacies of Oppenheimers personal life, revealing the human side of this legendary figure. This emotional connection fosters a deep sense of empathy and understanding, making Oppenheimer more than just a historical account—it becomes a profound reflection on the human experience. The films musical score, composed by a talented maestro, complements the narrative beautifully, adding another layer of emotional resonance to the story. The music enhances key moments and intensifies the emotions felt throughout the film, creating an immersive and unforgettable cinematic journey. In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves accolades for its exceptional storytelling, remarkable performances, and its ability to delve into the complexities of history and humanity. It celebrates the brilliance of J. Robert Oppenheimer while also encouraging us to contemplate the broader implications of scientific progress and the human spirit. A true gem among cinematic offerings, Oppenheimer is a must-watch for both history enthusiasts and those seeking a deeply moving and intellectually stimulating film experience."

    "review_sample2 = \"Where do I even begin with the Oppenheimer movie? Its a perplexing mess of a film that fails to capture the essence of its subject matter and leaves the audience scratching their heads in confusion. With high expectations due to its talented cast and promising premise, this movie ultimately disappoints on every level. First and foremost, the pacing is an absolute nightmare. The movie meanders aimlessly, dragging out scenes that add little to the plot and leaving essential elements underdeveloped. Its almost as if the filmmakers had no idea how to structure the narrative or maintain a cohesive flow. As a result, the movie feels like a jumbled collection of disconnected events that leave viewers struggling to make sense of the story. The characters in Oppenheimer are equally underwhelming. Despite the exceptional actors involved, their performances are hampered by a lack of depth and poorly written dialogues. The titular character, J. Robert Oppenheimer, comes across as one-dimensional and devoid of real personality or emotional resonance. Supporting characters receive even less attention, leaving us indifferent to their fates and unable to invest in their arcs. The films attempts at historical accuracy are laughable at best. While some creative liberties are expected in any biographical movie, Oppenheimer takes it to an extreme. The inaccuracies and distortions of actual events not only disrespect the legacy of those involved but also undermine the films credibility. The filmmakers were more interested in sensationalism than telling a compelling and fact-based story. Perhaps the most egregious aspect of the Oppenheimer movie is its lack of a coherent message or thematic depth. It raises significant moral and ethical questions about the development of nuclear weapons and their consequences, but it never delves into these issues with any real substance. Instead, the movie superficially glazes over these crucial aspects, leaving viewers with a sense of emptiness and missed opportunities. The cinematography and direction do little to salvage the films shortcomings. The visual style lacks creativity, and the director seems to rely on tired and overused cinematic clichés. The lack of a distinct visual identity only adds to the overall mediocrity of the movie. In conclusion, the Oppenheimer movie is a colossal disappointment. Its weak storytelling, poorly developed characters, historical inaccuracies, and lack of a compelling message all contribute to a film that is an absolute failure. Save your time and money and skip this cinematic disaster. There are far better biographical dramas out there that do justice to their subjects and deliver a more engaging and coherent experience.\"\n",

    "review_sample4 = \"Update: if you notice google is showing mostly 5 star reviews when there is almost an equal number of 1 stars to 5 stars hence why the average is 3 stars. Also the stupid webpage going pink like what?? when has google started promoting movies or when have you seen that done for another movie Title: An Absolute Disaster - 1 Star I just had the misfortune of watching the new Barbie movie, and I must say it was an absolute disaster. As a long-time Barbie fan, I was eager to see how they would bring this iconic character to life on the big screen. However, what I witnessed was nothing short of a soulless and poorly executed cash grab. First and foremost, the plot was a complete mess. It felt like the writers couldnt decide whether they wanted to create a meaningful storyline or just string together a series of clichés. The lack of originality was astounding, and I found myself predicting every twist and turn before it even happened. Furthermore, the characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or personality. Barbie herself, who is known for her empowering and inspiring qualities, was reduced to a vapid and superficial stereotype. The supporting characters were forgettable, and the so-called antagonist was laughably unconvincing. The animation was also a major disappointment. In an age where weve seen incredible advancements in animation technology, the visuals in this movie felt outdated and cheap. The movements were stiff, and the facial expressions lacked any nuance, making it difficult to connect with the characters on an emotional level. As if the lackluster plot and poor animation werent enough, the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the attempts at heartfelt moments felt forced and insincere. It seemed like the script was written without any consideration for the audiences intelligence or emotional investment. Additionally, the movie seemed more like a two-hour commercial for Barbie merchandise than a genuine attempt at storytelling. The constant product placements and blatant marketing tactics were incredibly off-putting and distracting. In conclusion, the new Barbie movie was a major letdown and a disservice to the beloved character and her fans. Instead of being an empowering and heartwarming film, it was a soulless money-making scheme that lacked any creativity or passion. Save your time and money and skip this one – its not worth it. The portrayal of men in the new Barbie movie was equally disappointing and added another layer of frustration to this already lackluster film. Throughout the movie, male characters were reduced to tired stereotypes and served as mere background figures to Barbies journey, reinforcing outdated gender roles. First and foremost, the male characters lacked any significant development. They were one-dimensional, bland, and existed primarily to either praise Barbie or act as obstacles for her to overcome. This reduction of male characters to supporting roles, devoid of any substance or complexity, was a disservice not only to the male characters themselves but also to the narrative as a whole. Furthermore, the few male characters that were given slightly more screen time were portrayed as either overly aggressive and competitive or overly emotional and weak.\"\n",

This futuristic masterpiece, directed by Gareth Edwards, takes you on an exhilarating journey into a world torn apart by a war between humanity and artificial intelligence. The plot is nothing short of brilliant, with unexpected twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. John David Washington delivers an outstanding performance as ex-special forces agent Joshua, leading an incredible cast that includes Gemma Chan, Ken Watanabe, Sturgill Simpson, Madeleine Yuna Voyles, and Allison Janney. Their chemistry on screen is electric, and they bring depth to their characters that is truly captivating. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, immersing you in a dystopian future filled with futuristic technology and breathtaking landscapes. The Creators AI in the form of a young child is both haunting and thought-provoking, adding layers of complexity to the story. This film is not just about action; its a thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of our technological advancements and the ethical questions surrounding artificial intelligence. Gareth Edwards and Chris Weitz have crafted a screenplay that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. In conclusion, this movie is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves every bit of its 5-star rating.

    "review_sample6 = \"They tried to cram too much stuff into this. Should have been made as a TV series or a trilogy of films. Wasted opportunity. They did a very sloppy job of setting up the premise of the story, so when they ask us to care about these characters in the second and third acts, it is very difficult for us to fo so because we feel so detached.  As far as the performances goes, The actor eho played Alphie( Child AI ) was wonderful. Gemma Chan was wasted, John David Washington was convincing enough. Couldnt care about anyone else due to lack of depth. Ken Watanabe was nice though, his character was more human than most of the human characters. The set design is decent. I read someone raving somewhere along the lines of  Set design makes blade runner look like a child . I am not sure which blade runner where they referring to ( 1982 original or 2017 sequel) , but it doesnt matter. There is nothing special in set design, and it cannot be compared to blade runner or any top tier Sci-Fi. Cinematography- I have seen better from Greg Fraser ( Dune, The Batman ). So this is not his strongest entry in the resume. Same goes for Hans Zimmers music. All I can say is that there is a score. I dont think it was utilized properly.  Also I think I heard Radioheads Paranoid Android from the infamous Kid A being played in one scene, which I thought was strange and out of place. To summarise, this is an ambitious film with lots of out of place politics stuffed in, although it looks like an original idea, the fact is that it is not. Westworld ( both films and TV series ) has done this before. In fact some scenes were ripped straight off from the series, especially from episodes The adversary (1x7) and Kiksuya (2x8), and the execution was far far better on Westworld.  This film is rushed, does not believe in the intelligence of the audience and does not take time to setup things properly. This ruined the experience for me personally. So dont get your expectations up. This is nothing to the likes of Nolan or Villeneuve. Walk in expecting nothing and you will have a decent experience. Another film that is destined to be go obscure , due to improper execution. If this was split into 2 or 3 films or a TV series, this would have turned out into a great cautionary tale.\"\n",

This is an AMAZING (Magnum Opus). You simply cant deny that Scorsese is the among all time greats, and this is definitely some of his finest work, at least it should be I conversation for that. ",
    "The collaboration with DP Rodrigo Prieto, production designer Jack Fisk was so tight, it created some of the best pictures of the year. It is definitely time to give Thelma Schoonmaker a GOAT status for editing and RIP do the legend Robbie Robertson, that bass line was so good at building tension, hope he gets some Oscar buzz. ",
    "Hands down.  ",
    "Leo and Marty are the best collab in cinema ever. At this point what else can I say about DiCaprio, he doesnt have a bad film in his resume, but this was an interesting role for him, maybe similar to Rick Dalton, but I love when he has a tantrum episode it is so funny. ",
    "De Niro was also soo sharp in this, him and Scorsese are iconic, but Lily Gladstone was something special, this was a breakthrough performance for her, and I loved it. ",
    " Lily Gladstone Will definitely win the Oscar for best actress as this was unreal. The story is so unique, I mean I cant believe that this happened and how people got out of it so easily.  unflinching, uncompromising, and careful with the story its trying to tell, killers of the flower moon sheds light on the tragic murders of the osage people, taking you in for a ride of human greed, corruption, and selfishness. Embarrassing for American government. It looked to me that Scorsese really stayed truer to Osage culture and people and presented them in the best way, and that made me so happy.  One of the worst genocide was committed against Native Americans and nobody is talking about it. ",
    " the runtime is definitely challenging, and the subject matter and pacing may not be for everyone, but i hope people really give this movie a chance. the ending of killers of the flower moon might be my favorite scene of 2023, as it twists the knife on the tragedy of the osage people. Cant wait to watch this again, one of the best films from this year! Up there with Oppenheimer for best picture. Written By Tyler Skeen\"\n",

I am getting the feeling this was billed as Leonardo DiCaprios finest performance of his entire career in order to get people to go see it. I also get the feeling a LOT of awards are going to come from this simply from the content of the story. There are just so many problems with it. It has difficult and confusing timelines and scenes that feel like they are misplaced. Leo seems like such a dim witted puppet that I wonder if the true story this is based on-whether that is accurate? Id like to know if this person was truly that ignorant, of literally everything. Lilly Gladstone was the most interesting character by far, although also-seems way too naive and such a victim for the time period. Like seriously? By the 20s you didnt know white people would do despicable things to you?! Also, absolutely no chemistry between Leo and Lilly. I often didnt buy either one of them even cared about the other. Also-the screen time for Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow?! Laughable. Again seems misplaced, unnecessary and only in the movie so it would be a star studded cast to get people to see it. And-there were parts of this movie that were genuinely intended to be funny. Only the white guilt plagued by the theater I was in left myself and my husband the only ones laughing. One more thing-to the makeup artist: we can totally see the glob of whatever stuck to Leos nose in a feeble attempt to make him more rustic for a period film. It was kind of funny actually. Trying to disguise him? Really just looked like large bad dentures and someone punched him in the nose… This film seemed more like a desperate attempt to just show that Martin S. can. Financially, connectedness, and age wise. DiCaprio films with better acting and could fit within best of his career: Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, The Aviator, Wolf of Wall Street. Just to give you a gauge on the best acting of his whole career claim.  And as others have lamented-this film had potential. It had the potential to show the tragedy from the Osage point of view. Instead they took a bunch of rich white dudes and showed it from their perspective. Not cool when its a story that NEEDED to be told. Instead the Osage characters were almost secondary and made to seem too naive.\"\n",
