# NSDC_F23_movie_reviews_project
In fall quarter of 2023, I completed a team project with National Student Data Corps at UCLA. Our team performed word sentiment analysis on a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews to learn which words were most influential in determining whether a review was positive or negative. 
Our final presentation is no longer available, though I was able to find the code that I wrote. Thus, this repository only contains my contributions. 
My tasks included:
- preprocessing the data
- running logistic regression on the data to assign a weight (coefficient) to each unique word that appeared in the data
- calculating the sum of the word weights for each review
- grouping reviews into bins based on summed word weights
- testing the validity of our bins on sample online movie reviews

The Kaggle dataset we used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
